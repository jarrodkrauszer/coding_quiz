## Technologies

 - We used a mixture of Javascript and HTML to create the pages
 - We are using Javascript to hide and show different divs on the main page
 - We are using Javascript to dynamically create the buttons for each question
 - We are also using localstorage to save and recall the high scores
 - Using flex on most of the divs for responsive design
